OutPut

start
end
resolve
setTimeout


Explained:

The code first logs 'start' and then sets up a setTimeout function with a delay of 0 milliseconds.
Next, a Promise is resolved with then() method which logs 'resolve'. Since Promises are resolved asynchronously, this statement is added to the microtask queue and executed after the current task is completed.
Then 'end' is logged.
Once the current task is completed, the event loop checks the microtask queue and executes the resolved Promise, which logs 'resolve'.
Finally, the setTimeout callback is executed and logs 'setTimeout'.
Note that the setTimeout delay of 0 milliseconds doesn't necessarily mean that it will execute immediately, but instead it will be queued after the current task and any pending microtasks.
