Explained
The first console.log('start') statement will be executed immediately when the code is run and will print 'start' to the console.

Two promises are then created using Promise.resolve. These promises will resolve immediately with a value of 1 and 2, respectively.

The first promise has a then method attached to it which will be executed asynchronously when the promise resolves. The then method will log the value of 1 to the console.

The second promise also has a then method attached to it which will be executed asynchronously when the promise resolves. The then method will log the value of 2 to the console.

Finally, the last console.log('end') statement will be executed immediately after the promises are created and will print 'end' to the console.
