A new promise is created with a resolved value of 2 and assigned to the variable promise.
The then method is called on promise, which logs the value 2 to the console and returns the value multiplied by 2 (resulting in 4).
Another then method is called on the previous promise chain, which logs the value 4 to the console and returns the value multiplied by 2 (resulting in 8).
The finally method is called on the previous promise chain, which logs undefined to the console, as it doesn't receive any arguments or return any values.
The final then method is called on the previous promise chain, which logs the value 8 to the console.
